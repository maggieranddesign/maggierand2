    <p>design club crit night poster! we split up the poster making duty for design club evenly among the board members to give everyone a chance to participate, this is one of my favorites. making posters for club events was a super fun way to play around with new concepts and make something new and eye-catching!</p>

<p>in april 2024 my best friend was in her final year of undergrad and was working on her thesis, she had a couple of prints that i had givent to her pinned up in her workspace in her school library and somebody stole them! now this friend and her sister are very interested in the heist of the rembrandts at the isabella stewart gardner museum and we found ourselves dealing with our own art heist! i made this poster for her to put up around the library at her school and the very next day the prints were safely returned and the theif left a note apologizing, we did what madame jack gardner couldn't and recovered the artwork!</p>
